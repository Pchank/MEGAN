## Model Description
### Main Networks and Gating Networks
<p align="center"><img width="100%" src="PNG/main_networks.PNG" /></p>
The proposed architecture of MEGAN; <b>(a)</b> shows the overview of our main networks. Given a latent vector <b>z</b>, each of the n generators produces an output o<sub>i</sub>. The latent vector <b>z</b> and n feature vectors (denoted in yellow) extracted from the generators are given as input to the gating networks that produce a one-hot vector <b>g</b>, as shown in the middle. The chosen image by the one-hot vector (marked as "Fake Image") will be fed into the discriminator that measures the adversarial loss with regard to both real and fake classes. <b>(b)</b> illustrates an in-depth view on the gating networks. The gating networks output a one-hot vector <b>g</b>.

## Results
### On CelebA dataset
<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="PNG/visual_celeb.PNG" /></p>
64x64 samples from MEGAN with each block of four images generated by the same generator. Noticeable differences between each block indicate that different generators produce images with different features.

### LSUN-Church outdoor
<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="PNG/visual_lsun.PNG" /></p>
64x64 samples from MEGAN with each block of four images generated by the same generator. Distinguishable features include the church architectural style, the location, and the cloud cover.
